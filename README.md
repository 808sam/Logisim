# Logisim
Things I've designed using the Logisim software, most notably some functions CPUs!
To view the circuits, you'll need the free Logisim software. I did not write the code, I only used Logisim to design logic circuits.

About the circuits
I've designed a few CPUs, each one better than the last. The first one I designed in high school when all I had heard was reference to the bus and a 2 bit binary adder,
I figured out the rest on my own. The next one was an improvment on that, and finally the third one was when I heard about microcode and made a much bettter design with it.

The GPU was an attempt at doing parallel processing with simplified CPUs. It's likely a very poor method of splitting up the workload, but it works nonetheless.

The Base Computer Components and Utility files are some experiments
